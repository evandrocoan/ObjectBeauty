# Formatting Configuration

This folder contains all the formatting settings available. This way each subfolder is an individual
settings for the language formatting. It is separated as this to group/tight together the
formatting settings and its Unit Test files.


The file `language_settings.txt` fits to set Languages Shadowing, i.e., several languages are too
similar to each other, then rather create several similar language settings a.k.a. duplicate
configurations, you just set the language X as similar to the language Y and across the settings
files, you just set what they differ.

To setup your own formatting style, an Sublime Text plugin is provided to easy your time.
