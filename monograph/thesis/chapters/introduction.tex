    \section{Context}

    Questions like ``What are good programming practices?'' Or ``Why are these
    practices are good?''Are not easy to answer. But each programmer learns to
    write their codes in a certain way, with certain features like using 4 or 8
    spaces to indent lines, always leave a blank line before each control
    structure as if or for statements, and alike rules.
    \cite{naturalCodingConventions}

    But entering the universe of good practices, there are many things for
    discoursing. Nonetheless, in this work is presented the implementation of
    tool called `Object Beautifier', which specifically dedicates on how to
    perform the best layout/display of programming code on the computer screen,
    so that maximize and facilitate the understanding of same
    \cite{automaticSynthesis}.
    Therefore, allowing the programmer to disperse
    more time and efforts thinking about its coding algorithms problem,
    other than trying to decipher the information that is presented
    to it on the screen through infinit different code layouts
    \cite{usingVersionControlData}.

    Within this work\s area, we need to also think long and hard about how to
    share the programming code of the programmers among you. Now, the problem of
    human diversity, like all big scientific questions -- how do you explain
    something like that -- It can be broken down into sub-questions. It happens
    many times, which is a good practice for a `Programmer A', is not the same
    to another `Programmer B'. For example, imagine some code where a programmer
    decided to put before each `if' statement, a blank line. It is therefore
    expected that whenever we see a blank line we can potentially find a
    matching `if', which can be considered a quite useful pattern matching as
    empty line may call better your attention. \cite{aPrettyGoodFormatting}

    But again this is something heavily dependent of what each one learning
    through their life time. Imagine another programmer do not liked this rule,
    and when he was writing your code involving an `if', he did not put such
    blank line another programmer is expecting. So when the first programmer
    start reading its the code and look for `if', he will be expecting for blank
    lines before its if\s. But will lose some time searching until realize
    another programmer does not put them, or perhaps he forgot to insert them.
    \cite{quantifyingProgramComprehension}

    These differences are due to the diversity of ways we learn programming,
    i.e., to the ways we are used to doing coding, as much as the abilities and
    objectives of every programmer developed. Hence, nowadays it becomes a big
    problem because we increasingly need more and more programmers working
    together developing several and diverse computing systems. Where the latter
    is due to the fact of the complexity of computer systems growing
    increasingly, therefore over requiring programmers working and sharing their
    codes and ideas. \cite{howProgrammersRead}

    Moreover besides only worrying about how the code is displayed on their
    computer screen, we need to worry about on how it will be saved in the file
    system on its `plain-text' mode. Since for code sharing, it is vital for you
    to use a versioning control system\footnote{\url{http://www.codeservedcold.com/version-control-importance/}}
    which enable project manager\s and
    programmers themselves, take control of their code changes
    \cite{redesignOfGit}. It does allow to easily perform the tracking of code
    changes \cite{gettingProductive} and
    allow you to better understand what each programmer is doing
    every time he formalizes a change in the code through a `commit', as in
    `git' systems for example. \cite{usingSourceControl}

    That is because while working with a versioning system like `git', we need
    to keep the code among a single style or which we may call a `good practice'
    set as standard for everybody, due the fact of letting each programmer to
    write as he pleases, there will be plenty of noise on the code review and we
    are figuring out what actually each programmer did \cite{quitDiffCalculating}.
    Hence, if every programmer re-writes the history making changes
    like inserting new lines
    before each if, we end up with too much noise and focus of a versioning
    system is to look at only those changes that are significant to the code,
    such as the creation of new functions and not the addition of new blank
    lines. \cite{findingRegressionsInProjects}

    Talking about the last ideia pointed out, we could also think about an
    approach to creating a new version control system which focuses only on
    significant changes to the code, while reviewing code changes. However, this
    approach could not be ideal, as for example, it would allow programmers to
    start tedious wars of unproductive code adjustments. For example, imagine
    how it would be for your every day and have to go through your code
    re-adding new lines before each one of your beloved if\s, just because some
    night shift programmer\footnote{\url{https://blog.codinghorror.com/who-wrote-this-crap/}}
    had just removed them?



    \section{Goals}

    The work first part will be based on research in
    articles, books, theses, dissertations, trusted authors websites,
    and through new demonstrated evidences based on arguments
    in the monograph evolution road.
    Also, present results after building a new tool
    which proposes a solution for the problems presented and detailed.

    In this proposal last chapter which lies on the part
    called `\nameref{sec:implementation}', which holds the implementation of a
    tool for code `Beautifying'.


    \subsection{Specific Goals}

    \begin{enumerate}

        \item Establish relationships between good programming practices and efficiency in
        programming, in addition to a new tool to support programmers in order to
        automate the long and diverse programming process in teams of developers
        with different programming `best practices'.

        \item Define, determine and classify which one are good programming
        practices and perform an in-depth study on the good practices on visual
        layout area, also known as code `Beautifying'.

        \item The definition of a flow pattern of development allowing teams of
        developers with different programming best practices, to work without
        intervene with each other up to start wars of `best good practices'.

        \item Discourse on the variety of existing tools for the support of good
        programming practices, with a comparative analysis between them,
        determining their weaknesses and strengths.

    \end{enumerate}



    \section{Implementation Goals}

    Propose a unique tool that allowing several and distinct
    programming `best practices' being implemented in several programming
    languages, which can be configured and set accordingly to their wishes,
    from a single software working well behaved across all programming languages.

    Moreover, explain the differences for other softwares and the benefits
    of a unique tool, instead of several heavily different ones.
