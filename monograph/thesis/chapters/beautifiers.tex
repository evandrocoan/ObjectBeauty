\chapter{Source Code Beautifiers}
\label{source_code_beautifiers}


    Below there are some basic formatting rules for
    illustration:\footnote{\url{https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#should-a-line-break-before-or-after-a-binary-operator}}

    \medskip
    % \begin{bluebox}
    \begin{enumerate}[nosep,nolistsep]
        \item Add new lines after `\{' and before `\}
        \item Add new lines before `\{'
        \item Remove empty lines
        \item Add comment lines before function
        \item Add new lines after `;'
        \item Add new lines after `\}'
        \item Remove new lines
        \item Reduce whitespace
        \item Fix bad indentation
    \end{enumerate}
    % \end{bluebox}
    \vspace{-4mm}\begin{flushright}\textcite{prettyPrinter}\end{flushright}

    Mostly,
    code formatting is recuded into this set of changes.



    \section{For what is their use?}

    For now could not find any strong evidence or correlation about code
    comprehension and source code beautifying \cite{improvingCodeReadability},
    except perhaps for team annoyance:

    \begin{citacao}
    % \setlength{\itemindent}{5pt}
    One of absolute worst, worst methods of teamicide for software developers is to engage
    in these kinds of passive-aggressive formatting wars. I know because I've been there.
    They destroy peer relationships, and depending on the type of formatting, can also damage
    your ability to effectively compare revisions in source control, which is really scary.
    I can't even imagine how bad it would get if the lead was guilty of this behavior. That's
    leading by example, all right. Bad example. \cite{Atwood}
    \end{citacao}

    On \citeonline{improvingCodeReadability} was analyzed the level of program
    comprehension which can be gained by the indentation and was constated that
    the indentation levels of 2 and 4 spaces proved to have the best
    comprehension levels again other levels.

    \begin{citacao}
    So yes, absurd as it may sound, fighting over whitespace characters and other seemingly
    trivial issues of code layout is actually justified. Within reason of course -- when done
    openly, in a fair and concensus building way, and without stabbing your teammates in the
    face along the way. \cite{Atwood}
    \end{citacao}

    With this ObjectBeautifier, we can edit XML files like YAML files, because
    the when we load the XML, we create a copy (the YAML version of the XML) on
    the `.object-beauty` folder which is edited by Sublime Text, and let the
    XML on its original place. Then when we save our YAML copy, we translate it
    to the XML original copy.

    TODO

    On a distributed version control system,
    continuous integration would be continuously running the system tests
    as long new code is integrated into main system
    from the distributed clients \cite{continuousIntegration}.
