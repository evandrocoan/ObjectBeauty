\chapter{Source Code Beautifiers}


    Below there are some basic formatting rules for illustration:

    \medskip
    \begin{bluebox}
    \begin{enumerate}[nosep,nolistsep]
        \item Add new lines after `\{' and before `\}
        \item Add new lines before `\{'
        \item Remove empty lines
        \item Add comment lines before function
        \item Add new lines after `;'
        \item Add new lines after `\}'
        \item Remove new lines
        \item Reduce whitespace
        \item Put the code again in the input box above after submit
    \end{enumerate}
    \end{bluebox}
    \vspace{-4mm}\begin{flushright}\textcite{prettyPrinter}\end{flushright}


    \section{For what is their use?}

    For now could not find any strong evidence or correlation about code
    comprehension and source code beautifying .


    \begin{citacao}
    % \setlength{\itemindent}{5pt}
    One of absolute worst, worst methods of teamicide for software developers is to engage
    in these kinds of passive-aggressive formatting wars. I know because I've been there.
    They destroy peer relationships, and depending on the type of formatting, can also damage
    your ability to effectively compare revisions in source control, which is really scary.
    I can't even imagine how bad it would get if the lead was guilty of this behavior. That's
    leading by example, all right. Bad example. \cite{Atwood}
    \end{citacao}

    \begin{citacao}
    So yes, absurd as it may sound, fighting over whitespace characters and other seemingly
    trivial issues of code layout is actually justified. Within reason of course -- when done
    openly, in a fair and concensus building way, and without stabbing your teammates in the
    face along the way. \cite{Atwood}
    \end{citacao}
